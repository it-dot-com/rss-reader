This is supposed to give us a glimpse at how you write code. It is a timed exercise. As you know by now, you have a limited amount of time to do this in so don't belabor options. If you have to make a decision do so quickly and if it turns out to be a bad one, revisit it when you need to.

The task is as follows:
Allow the user to enter a url for an RSS feed and go out and collect the information for that rss feed. Process the feed. The interface should show <N> number of results as links to the articles in the feed. Also, the results should last through a browser refresh.

This is purposefully ambiguous so that you get a chance to make a lots of decisions yourself, but note that there isn't a "right" answer.

rss_reader_clean.html is a skeleton framework should you want to use it but it is very barebones.

Also, we ask that you please do not publish this publicly.
